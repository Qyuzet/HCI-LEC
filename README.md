**Interaction Design = Create a Conversation** 
* Human <--> Product/System/Service

**Good Interaction Design IS:**
* Engaging: Works for different users (culture, abilities)
* Goal-Oriented: Easy to use AND enjoyable experience
* Iterative: Design, Test, Refine (based on user feedback)

**Design Methods (Like Tools in a Toolbox):**
* User-Centered: Ask users what they need!
* Genius: Trust the designer's gut (risky if wrong)
* Activity-Centered: Focus on the user's TASKS
* Design Sprint:  Fast testing of ideas

**User's Brain Matters (Cognition):**
* Attention:  Don't make them hunt for things
* Perception: Make it obvious what things ARE
* Memory: Easy to recognize, hard to remember everything
* Language:  Speak their language (clearly!)
* Metacognition: Help users understand the system

**Mental Models = "How I Think It Works"**
* Design should match what users ALREADY believe

**Golden Rules of Design:**
* Visibility: Can I SEE what matters?
* Feedback: Did it WORK? Tell me!
* Constraints:  Prevent me from messing up
* Consistency:  Don't change the rules on me!
* Affordance:  Make it LOOK like what it DOES
